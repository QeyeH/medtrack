## What is MedTrack?

Is a Tcl8.6.7 program to help users manage their prescribed medications. Having to be legally prescribed, regular medications is a burden enough and having to track the supply, use and reordering of these medications is another burden on top of the existing health issues.

## How does Medtrack work?

MedTrack works by initially recording your current medication variables, such as:

* Start date
* Medicines on hand (If any)
* Daily dose
* Medicine per doses
* Quantity issued by the Pharmacy
* Number of repeat presecriptions (If any)
* Recommended date of reissue or reorder
* Calculated days of supply

## Who can use MedTrack?

Anyone who is legally prescribed medications or anyone who supports such a person either within a family or even for profit.
