## What is MedTrack?

MedTrack is a Tcl 8.6.7 program to help users manage their legally, prescribed medications.

Having to be legally prescribed, regular medications is a burden, and having to track the supply, use and reordering of these medications is a further burden that at times can be very frustrating and concerning.

MedTrack aims to make this process, a little easier.

* Calculated days of supply
* Recommended date of reissue/reorder

* Anyone who supports such a person, either as a volunteer or for profit
